# One-sample Mendelian randomization practical

In this practical, we demonstrate how to use one-sample Mendelian randomization with a single instrument or weighted allele score to estimate the causal effect of one phenotype on another. Specifically, we use one-sample Mendelian randomization to estimate the causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on the inflammatory biomarker, C-reactive protein (CRP). Test your knowledge by seeing if you can repeat this analysis in the opposite direction - i.e. using the genetic variants in the genes CRP, HNF1A and APOC1 either as single instruments or in a weighted allele score to proxy CRP and calculate the causal effect on BMI - good luck!
